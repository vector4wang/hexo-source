每位学医的入学第一课就是希波克拉底誓言：
<!-- more -->
医神阿波罗、埃斯克雷彼斯及天地诸神作证，我———希波克拉底发誓：
>我愿以自身判断力所及，遵守这一誓约。凡教给我医术的人，我应像尊敬自己的父母一样，尊敬他。作为终身尊重的对象及朋友，授给我医术的恩师一旦发生危急情况，我一定接济他。把恩师的儿女当成我希波克拉底的兄弟姐妹；如果恩师的儿女愿意从医，我一定无条件地传授，更不收取任何费用。对于我所拥有的医术，无论是能以口头表达的还是可书写的，都要传授给我的儿女，传授给恩师的儿女和发誓遵守本誓言的学生；除此三种情况外，不再传给别人。
>我愿在我的判断力所及的范围内，尽我的能力，遵守为病人谋利益的道德原则，并杜绝一切堕落及害人的行为。我不得将有害的药品给予他人，也不指导他人服用有害药品，更不答应他人使用有害药物的请求。尤其不施行给妇女堕胎的手术。我志愿以纯洁与神圣的精神终身行医。因我没有治疗结石病的专长，不宜承担此项手术，有需要治疗的，我就将他介绍给治疗结石的专家。
>无论到了什么地方，也无论需诊治的病人是男是女、是自由民是奴婢，对他们我一视同仁，为他们谋幸福是我惟一的目的。我要检点自己的行为举止，不做各种害人的劣行，尤其不做诱奸女病人或病人眷属的缺德事。在治病过程中，凡我所见所闻，不论与行医业务有否直接关系，凡我认为要保密的事项坚决不予泄漏。
>我遵守以上誓言，目的在于让医神阿波罗、埃斯克雷彼斯及天地诸神赐给我生命与医术上的无上光荣；一旦我违背了自己的誓言，请求天地诸神给我最严厉的惩罚！

### 英译

>“I swear by Apollo Physician and Asclepius and Hygieia and Panaceia and all the gods and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that I will fulfil according to my ability and judgment this oath and this covenant:
>To hold him who has taught me this art as equal to my parents and to live my life in partnership with him, and if he is in need of money to give him a share of mine, and to regard his offspring as equal to my brothers in male lineage and to teach them this art - if they desire to learn it - without fee and covenant; to give a share of precepts and oral instruction and all the other learning to my sons and to the sons of him who has instructed me and to pupils who have signed the covenant and have taken an oath according to the medical law, but no one else.
>I will apply dietetic measures for the benefit of the sick according to my ability and judgment; I will keep them from harm and injustice. I will neither give a deadly drug to anybody who asked for it, nor will I make a suggestion to this effect. Similarly I will not give to a woman an abortive remedy. In purity and holiness I will guard my life and my art. I will not use the knife, not even on sufferers from stone, but will withdraw in favor of such men as are engaged in this work.
>Whatever houses I may visit, I will come for the benefit of the sick, remaining free of all intentional injustice, of all mischief and in particular of sexual relations with both female and male persons, be they free or slaves. What I may see or hear in the course of the treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself, holding such things shameful to be spoken about.
>If I fulfil this oath and do not violate it, may it be granted to me to enjoy life and art, being honored with fame among all men for all time to come; if I transgress it and swear falsely, may the opposite of all this be my lot.”
